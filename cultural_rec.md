## Cultural Recs

I would recommend reading more in 2024, and [here](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/b/books/awards/best-books-of-the-year/_/N-29Z8q8Z1qrh) you can find a list of books that were nominated as best books of the year 2023 in many genres by Barnes and Noble.

One of my favorite reads was Fourth Wing, which is on this list in best fiction and best fantasy of 2023.
